# Milestone Project 1

This project is based on a corporate events / wedding band that has a growing fan base in Ireland and the Uk. 

The main objectives for the site are to book more gigs and also gain more followers on social media. 

# UX

Based on my user story, this website is designed for three types of users:

1. Companies that are looking to book exciting corporate entertainment for an upcoming social or team building event.
1. Wedding couples that are looking to book great live entertainment for their wedding reception.
1. Fans and followers that know the band and have been to previous events but would like to find out more about the band and where to find and follow us on social media.

## User 1 - Corporate Bookings
From research many of small to medium size companies hold up to 3 social events and 10 team building events each business year. These can range from gala dinners to motivational speaking and of course the annual Christmas Party.

Each of these events require appropriate professional entertainment. The purpose of our website is to provide information on the band's experience with corporate entertainment while also showing the user a live video of the band in action entertaining at a large function. This shows the user they have come to right place and our band the only band for your event.

From here we will simply guide our user to fill out our contact form and proceed with a swift booking of the band based on availability. 

We understand our corporate users are very busy and have other commitments to their day, our website's visual and text content assures them they are making the correct choice and can now focus their attention on other tasks.

## User 2 - Wedding Couples
From researching the wedding industry we have seen that this is a very different type of user to corporate bookings. Many Brides and Grooms prefer to most of their own planning and the planning in itself becomes a ritual in the 12 to 24 months leading up to a wedding. Couples wil create checklists and budgets starting from wedding dress and venue and work their way down to finer details of inviations and honeymoon destinations.

There are on average 20,000 weddings in Ireland alone each year with an average cost of â‚¬28000 for a wedding. Our research tells us wedding couples use strict budgets and enjoy attending fairs and showcases which will include looking at a least 4 wedding bands.

With this in mind we are aware of creating an emotional response in our wedding couples in order for them to commit to a booking. To do this we have laid out our website elegantly and simply with clean sharp imagery of our band conveying an exciting atmosphere. Our live video is key here and the songs are very important. They must appeal to a wide tartget audience and come across and slick, exciting, charismatic and well rehearsed. 

At this point we will guide the couples to complete our booking form or at the very least enquire about a possible booking.

## User 3 - Fans and followers
This type of user is just as important as any other as one of the things potential clients will check is out social media accounts as it evokes trust and brand awareness. Potential clients will be looking at how many followers the band have aswell as extra images from past live events. It is vital we use our website to push our presence on social media platforms such as facebook and instagram.

Many of our audiences from past events tend to follow us on social media the next day and comment on pictures we post from the events they attended. We have decided our website is a great option to reinforce this behaviour. We have incorporated an ABOUT US page where visitors can learn more about each member of the band and any of our upcoming shows. 

To encourage new visitors landing on our website to follow us on facebook we have created a competiton form on our Home page with a link to facebook encouraging users to like and follow us.
